publist
=======

DokuWiki plugin for citations and publication lists

Find more information on the [DokuWiki plugin repository](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:publist).
The most current version is probably available on [one of the branches](https://github.com/akerbos/publist/network) 
since I stopped actively working on this plugin.


Uses [bib2tpl](https://github.com/akerbos/bib2tpl) internally, which I still maintain.
